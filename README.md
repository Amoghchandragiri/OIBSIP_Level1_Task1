# Elite-Sports-Center
Explore our wide range of indoor and outdoor sports activities and you can select your preferred choice of sports activities whose description is given in the upcoming pages.


This website consists of 5 pages made using HTML,CSS and Javascript,PHP and XAMPP web server. It is dynamic in nature. It contains services offered by the Sports Club and detailed description of each service. It also contains a feedback mechanism to address the queries of customers and a login page using which customers can avail the facilities by giving their necessary credentials.

The feedback and register[login] page won't be seen in hosting of github pages,as it can only host static web pages. For that download xampp web server and start apache and mysql services:-
1) create a database named sports
2) create sports and sports1 tables with appropriate columns given in code and set databasename=root and databasepassword=""
3) configure web server address like in my case, it is 127.0.0.1:3307.If no clash with mysql port, web server address will be localhost=127.0.0.1.
4) run on browser:- localhost/projectname
